## 1️⃣ Overview

Africa is one of the fastest-growing regions for digital work, cross-border trade, and online services. Yet, African individuals and businesses face structural barriers in **receiving and managing global income** efficiently.

Existing solutions — traditional banks, digital wallets, and payment providers like PayPal or Stripe — are often **slow, expensive, or fragmented**, creating friction for earning, settling, and utilizing foreign currency.

WGI addresses this **structural pain** by becoming a bank-agnostic, multi-currency, cross-border financial infrastructure platform.

## 2️⃣ Key Problems

### A. Fragmented Banking Ecosystem

* Many African countries have **dozens of banks**, each with different APIs, settlement rules, and processing times.
* SMEs and freelancers often need **multiple bank accounts** to receive global payments efficiently.
* Current systems do **not interoperate seamlessly**, increasing operational complexity.

**Impact:** Delayed revenue, increased costs, and cash flow inefficiencies.

---

### B. Slow and Costly Cross-Border Payments

* International platforms like PayPal or Wise charge **high fees and FX spreads**.
* Settlements can take **days**, particularly when local banks are intermediaries.
* Currency conversion is often **suboptimal**, eroding earnings.

**Impact:** Loss of income, reduced competitiveness, and low adoption of global digital services.

---

### C. Limited Access to Global Financial Infrastructure

* Most African freelancers, exporters, and SMEs **cannot get USD/EUR/GBP collection accounts easily**.
* Card issuing for foreign currency is often **restricted or expensive**.
* Access to credit or liquidity against foreign earnings is largely unavailable.

**Impact:** Businesses are cash-constrained, and individuals cannot leverage earnings for growth or consumption.

---

### D. Lack of Intelligent Settlement and FX Optimization

* Earnings often sit idle in local bank accounts before being converted or used.
* No platform currently **optimizes liquidity routing** across multiple banks for speed or cost.

**Impact:** Suboptimal FX, delayed access to funds, and revenue leakage.

---

### E. Limited Infrastructure for Fintech Integration

* African fintechs often rely on **single banks** or third-party providers.
* This creates a **single point of failure** and slows scaling.

**Impact:** Tech startups struggle to access global payment rails efficiently.

## 3️⃣ Evidence & Market Signals

* **Freelancer Market:** Africa’s digital freelance economy is growing at ~20% YoY, with Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa leading.
* **Cross-Border Payments:** Africans send/receive over **$50B annually**, with average fees exceeding **5–7%**, sometimes up to 15% for small payments.
* **Banking Fragmentation:** 50+ regulated banks in Kenya alone; similar density in Nigeria, South Africa, and East Africa.
* **PayPal Limitations:** Many Africans face account freezes, holds, and inability to withdraw funds efficiently.

---

## 4️⃣ Root Cause

1. **Legacy banking infrastructure** is siloed and not designed for global digital commerce.
2. **Existing fintechs** focus on consumer-facing apps, not **infrastructure**.
3. **Liquidity and FX management** are not optimized for multi-bank, multi-currency needs.
4. African businesses lack a **single trusted financial operating layer** bridging global income → local liquidity.

---

## 5️⃣ Consequence

* **Revenue leakage** for businesses and individuals
* **Slow access to funds** and operational inefficiency
