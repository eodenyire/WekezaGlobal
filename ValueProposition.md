## 5️⃣ WGI's Strategic Moat

### 1. Infrastructure Position
WGI is positioned as **infrastructure**, not a consumer app. This means:
- Fintechs and banks integrate WGI rather than compete with it
- Network effects grow with each bank and partner added
- Switching costs increase with each API integration

### 2. Founding Liquidity Partner: Wekeza Bank
- Wekeza Bank provides **first-mover liquidity** and preferential FX rates
- This creates an immediate competitive advantage on rate quality
- Partnership ensures regulatory standing and local credibility

### 3. Multi-Bank Orchestration
- **20+ African banks** integrated at launch (Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, Rwanda)
- Competitors are **single-rail** solutions; WGI is **multi-rail**
- Redundancy means higher uptime and better rates through competition

### 4. Data Asset: Credit Intelligence
- Every transaction builds a proprietary behavioral credit dataset
- No existing platform in Africa has this combination of global income + local settlement data
- Long-term moat: credit scoring → lending products → financial inclusion

### 5. Compliance-First Design
- Built for CBK (Kenya), CBN (Nigeria), SARB (South Africa) from day one
- KYC/AML centralized — reduces barrier for fintech partners
- Regulatory moat: compliance infrastructure takes years to build

> WGI delivers the lowest-cost, fastest, and most reliable path from **global income to African liquidity** — through a bank-agnostic multi-currency infrastructure platform that eliminates the fragmentation, FX losses, and settlement delays that cost African earners and businesses **billions of dollars annually**.
