## 1. Executive Summary

Wekeza Global Infrastructure (WGI) is a bank-agnostic cross-border financial infrastructure platform designed to enable African individuals and businesses to receive, manage, convert, and deploy global currencies seamlessly.

Unlike traditional banks or standalone fintech wallets, WGI integrates with multiple banks, card networks, and liquidity providers to create a unified multi-currency wallet and settlement engine.

The platform will:

* Provide global collection accounts (USD, EUR, GBP)
* Enable instant FX conversion
* Allow withdrawals to any Kenyan bank
* Offer virtual USD cards
* Support multi-bank integrations (including Wekeza Bank)
* Build toward a credit intelligence engine powered by transaction behavior

WGI positions itself as infrastructure, not just a wallet — enabling freelancers, SMEs, exporters, and fintech startups to plug into global commerce rails efficiently.

## 2. Vision Statement

To become Africa’s most trusted cross-border financial infrastructure layer, enabling seamless global earnings and liquidity access for individuals and businesses.

---

## 3. Mission Statement

To remove friction in cross-border payments by building a multi-bank, multi-currency, intelligent financial platform that connects Africa to global markets in real time.

---

## 4. Strategic Positioning

WGI is positioned as:

* A Payment Infrastructure Platform
* A Multi-Bank Financial Orchestration Layer
* A Cross-Border Settlement Engine
* A Future Credit Intelligence Network

It is NOT:

* Just a neobank
* Just a remittance app
* Just a Payoneer clone
* A single-bank product

It is infrastructure.

## 5. Target Market – Phase 1 (Kenya)

Primary:

* Freelancers earning USD remotely
* Tech agencies serving international clients
* Remote workers paid via PayPal, Wise, etc.
* Export SMEs receiving foreign currency

Secondary:

* E-commerce sellers (Amazon, Shopify)
* NGOs receiving grants
* Startups billing global customers

---

## 6. Core Problem Being Solved

African earners and businesses face:

* High FX spreads
* Slow settlement times
* Payment holds (especially via PayPal)
* Limited access to global collection accounts
* Fragmented banking integrations
* Inability to leverage foreign earnings for credit
* Poor liquidity optimization

The result:

* Revenue leakage
* Liquidity constraints
* Working capital inefficiencies
* Credit invisibility

---

## 7. The Big Idea

Build a multi-currency wallet and settlement infrastructure that:

* Integrates multiple Kenyan banks
* Connects to global payment rails
* Routes settlement intelligently
* Optimizes FX dynamically
* Enables programmable financial access

This becomes the operating layer between:

Global Income → African Liquidity
